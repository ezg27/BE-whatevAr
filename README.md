# WhatevAR-BE

WhatevAR is an augmented reality (AR) application built with ViroReact developer platform and React Native. The app takes the user's current location and projects virtual icons representing local bars and restaurants when user is scanning his surroundings. User can hover over an icon to see information about particular establishment such as categories, Yelp rating and price range, then click on the icon to see a full screen modal containing contact details, opening times, pictures and Food Hygiene rating.
